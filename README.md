# Preconditioned-methods-for-Linear-Systems
Comparation between preconditioned methods to solve linear systems:

- We will explore precoditioned methods to solve linear systems such as jacobi, richardson and gauss-siedel (the symmetric one)
- These methods are going to be implemented in matlab
- Of coure, feel free to modify the code and run it on your pc!
- The gen-prefix files are functions that create some specific matrix like a poisson matrix or a diagonal dominant one
- The metodo-prefix files are functions that implement different methods to solve linear systems
- The two ris-prefis files are functions to solve a linear system with an upper triangular matrix and a lower triangular one (used in the symmetric gauss-seidel method)
- Lastly, the script-prefix file is, of course, a script where we compare the runtime and the convergence speed for every method examined, and then plot the results

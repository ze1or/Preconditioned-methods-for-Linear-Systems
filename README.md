# Preconditioned-methods-for-Linear-Systems
Comparation between preconditioned methods to solve linear systems:

- We will explore precoditioned methods to solve linear systems such as jacobi, richardson and gauss-siedel (the symmetric one)
- These methods are going to be implemented in matlab
- Of coure, feel free to modify the code and run it on your pc!
